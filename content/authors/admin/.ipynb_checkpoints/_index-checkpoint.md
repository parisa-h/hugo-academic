I am a Research Scientist at J.P. Morgan AI Research, Palo Alto, CA. My current research interests are in adversarial machine learning and reinforcement learning. I received my Ph.D. degree in 2019 in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the Tandon School of Engineering at New York University, advised by Dr. Elza Erkip. My Ph.D. research was in information theory and wireless communications with an emphasis on caching for wireless video delivery, and applications for the next generation of cellular systems.
