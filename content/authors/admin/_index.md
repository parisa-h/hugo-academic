I am a Senior ML Scientist at Samsung SDS working on generative AI, and prior to that I spent a few years as an AI researcher at J.P. Morgan working on advesarial ML and reinforcement learning. I received my Ph.D. degree in 2019 in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the Tandon School of Engineering at New York University, advised by Dr. Elza Erkip. My Ph.D. research was in information theory and wireless communications with an emphasis on caching for wireless video delivery, and applications for the next generation of cellular systems.
